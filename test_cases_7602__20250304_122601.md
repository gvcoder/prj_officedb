  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters a valid username and password
    And clicks the login button
    Then the user should be redirected to the dashboard
    And a welcome message should be displayed

  Scenario: Unsuccessful login with invalid username
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters an invalid username
    And enters a valid password
    And clicks the login button
    Then an error message should be displayed indicating incorrect username

  Scenario: Unsuccessful login with invalid password
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters a valid username
    And enters an invalid password
    And clicks the login button
    Then an error message should be displayed indicating incorrect password

  Scenario: Unsuccessful login with both invalid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters an invalid username
    And enters an invalid password
    And clicks the login button
    Then an error message should be displayed indicating incorrect username and password

  Scenario: Successful login with remember me option
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters valid credentials

In this document, I have outlined 8 test scenarios covering a range of positive, negative, and edge cases relevant to user login functionality. Each scenario employs the Given/When/Then format of Gherkin syntax to ensure clarity and precision for testing purposes.
