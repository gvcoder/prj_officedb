Feature: RabbitMQ Message Queue Functionality

  Background:
    Given the RabbitMQ server is running
    And a queue named "testQueue" is created

  # Positive Scenarios

  Scenario: Publish a message to the queue successfully
    When I publish a message "Hello RabbitMQ" to "testQueue"
    Then the message should be in "testQueue"
    And the message count for "testQueue" should be 1

  Scenario: Consume a message from the queue successfully
    Given I have published a message "Hello RabbitMQ" to "testQueue"
    When I consume a message from "testQueue"
    Then the consumed message should be "Hello RabbitMQ"
    And the message count for "testQueue" should be 0

  Scenario: Acknowledge a consumed message correctly
    Given I have published a message "Hello RabbitMQ" to "testQueue"
    When I consume a message from "testQueue"
    And I acknowledge the consumed message
    Then the message count for "testQueue" should be 0

  Scenario: Publish multiple messages to the queue
    When I publish messages "Message 1", "Message 2", "Message 3" to "testQueue"
    Then the message count for "testQueue" should be 3

  # Negative Scenarios

  Scenario: Attempt to publish a message to a non-existent queue
    When I try to publish a message "Hello" to "nonExistentQueue"
    Then an error message "Queue not found" should be returned

  Scenario: Consume from an empty queue
    Given I have not published any messages to "testQueue"
    When I try to consume a message from "testQueue"
    Then an error message "No messages to consume" should be returned

  # Edge Scenarios

  Scenario: Publish a very large message to the queue
    When I publish a message of size 10MB to "testQueue"
    Then the message should be acknowledged
    And the message count for "testQueue" should be 1

  Scenario: Consume a message from a queue that has reached maximum message limit
    Given I have published 100 messages to "testQueue" (considering limit is 100)
    When I try to publish a new message "Message 101" to "testQueue"
    Then an error message "Queue limit reached" should be returned

This suite of test cases covers various scenarios of RabbitMQ functionality, ensuring both normal and edge cases are considered in order to validate effective queue operations.
